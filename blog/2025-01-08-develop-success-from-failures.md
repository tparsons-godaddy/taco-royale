Hey team!

It's that time of the year again - self evaluations. This is definitely the worst part, I have no idea how to write about myself, I don't know about you.

Unfortauntely, we have lost a feew of our team members as we move into the new year. The other teams have gained some truly amazing people, though, and I look forward to hearing of their successes.

Starting this week, I am adding a new section with the most interesting engineering blog post I have found. There are so many around that get lost in the vast realms of the internet that I will share them and make them easier to find.
