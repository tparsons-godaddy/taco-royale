Hey friends!

I hope you’re having a good week! This is post #1. Let’s see how this goes. Really this is just a way for me to explore Astro.js and share some stuff with the team. I hope you find something interesting.

### Something that interested me this week

I’m loving playing with Astro.js at the moment. After building a very basic app for my Coffee Hour presentation last week, I’ve been messing around with it a bit more and redesigned what I made (this blog). I will keep playing with it and see what other interesting features it has.

### Cool things from around the internet
