Hey team!

This week has been a tough one. Working on a workflow in AWS, I corrupted all of the test data we had in one DEV account - the only account that everyone was using for testing. A lot of hours have been spent trying to revert the problems to no avail. Maybe there's something there that I need to focus on.
