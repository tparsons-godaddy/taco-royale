Hey team!

Another new sprint - this time back to the original crew.
Exciting to see all of the Google Ads work come together. Let's push on and get our customer's websites out to everyone.
I don't know about you but the call in the Q3 All Hands meeting with one of our customers was really useful. Hopefully, we will see more of those in the future.
