# 2025 Brag Document

Brag Document in which I list my accomplishments throughout the year in a daily based list. Motivation is to keep track of my daily work on my career in which I can later reflect upon it. Also, avoiding the feeling of confusion when looking back on my previous accomplishments.

# Goal
Keep a record of things I've done throughout the day, month, year, to have a document in which I can reflect upon it and improve myself.
