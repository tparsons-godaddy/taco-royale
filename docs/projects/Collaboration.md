## Collaboration & Mentorship

E.g: helping others in an area youâ€™re an expert in, mentorship program, writing clear meeting notes, improving monitoring/dashboards, foundational code other people built on top of, code reviews you did think had a positive impact, important questions you answered, giving an internal talk etc.
